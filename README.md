HypeStore is a **convenient and free Android app store** for standard apps and open source projects, complementary to the Play Store, that allows you to keep your software up to date and discover new software without restrictions from Google. You can submit your own projects and apps through HypeDev application or sending me a email to *agayol@duck.com* with all neccesary information and files.

### Projects
As all **"project"** tagged apps are free and open source, they are completely safe and secure to use. You can support their developers donating some money so they can improve their apps. Projects usually offer quality experiences and alternatives to Big Tech services and are done by developers without profit motive. Some examples are Newpipe, VLC and Firefox.

### Standard Apps
Closed source apps with profit motive are tagged as **"standard apps"**. Some examples are Facebook, Twitter and Google. We get official versions of popular apps and scan everything through several antiviruses to guarantee safe software.

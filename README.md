HypeStore is a **convenient and free Android app store** for open source projects, complementary to the Play Store, that allows you to keep your software up to date and discover new projects without restrictions from Google. You can submit your own projects through HypeDev application or sending me a email to *agayol@duck.com*.

## Features

<img src="/assets/Features_sign.PNG" width="300">

- 🧭 **Explore:** Find popular finished or beta projects that may be useful in your daily life.
- ⬇️ **Updates:** Get APK updates from your favorite FOSS apps directly from HypeStore.
- 🎨 **Light and dark mode**: You can also set a light and a dark interval for different times of the day.
- 🐈‍⬛ **GitHub integration:** Allows you to see stars and contributors of the projects.
- ⭐️ **Alternative ratings:** Instead of just rating the apps from 1 to 5, you can also rate separately aspects like:
  - **Idea** (good or bad concept?) 💡
  - **Usage** (it has bugs or it's clean and smooth?) ☁️
  - **Storage and battery waste** (should it be lighter?) 🔋
  - **Translations** (if there are translations, they are natural or unreadable?) 🌏
  - **Design and color palette** (it looks great or it blinds you?) 🖼
- 🔒 **No tracking**: HypeStore doesn't track you at all. There are not accounts. When you rate an app, we use to identify you a randomly generated 10 digits code in your phone that isn't related to your identity or your IP.
